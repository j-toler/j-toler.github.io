      <description>Introduction:We initially wanted to obtain datasets to explore the relationships between food, food insecurity, and prices. However, due to not meeting the initial dataset constraints, we pivoted and decided to develop datasets instead, using data housed in the World Development Indicators database (World Development Indicators.org). These variables were selected because the potential relationships amongst the datasets could be interesting and valuable in shaping how we examine the effect that standard country metrics could be affected by or related to how much of the country’s population is malnourished.</description>
